# Lung-Cancer-Detection-and-Classification-
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for lung cancer detection and classification. The project focuses on utilizing advanced neural networks to identify and classify lung cancer patterns from medical images. Different CNN architectures were used in this project. Moreover, image augmentation techniques such as GANs and Autoencoder were implemented
