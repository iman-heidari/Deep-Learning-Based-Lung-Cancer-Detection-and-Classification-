# Lung-Cancer-Detection-and-Classification-
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning model for lung cancer detection and classification. The project focuses on utilizing advanced neural networks to identify and classify lung cancer patterns from medical images. Different CNN architectures were used in this project. Moreover, image augmentation techniques such as GANs and Autoencoder were implemented
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle, a platform that hosts various datasets and machine learning challenges. Unfortunately, due to Kaggle's terms of service, we cannot provide the dataset directly within this repository. However, you can easily access the dataset by visiting the Kaggle website and searching for the appropriate dataset related to lung cancer images.
